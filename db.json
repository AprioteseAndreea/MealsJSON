    "ingredients": "¼ cup coconut oil, ¼ cup honey or pure maple syrup for vegan option, ½ tsp pure vanilla extract, 2 cups old-fashioned oats, ½ cup unsweetened shredded coconut, ½ cup raw pecans chopped, 2 tsp ground cinnamon, ½ tsp sea salt",
    "howtoprepare" : "Mix dry ingredients. Start by mixing the dry ingredients together, then set them aside! Combine & warm the wet ingredients. The trick here is you want to gently warm them either in the microwave or on the stovetop until they are just warm enough to be smooth and combined.Add Vanilla. be sure to add the vanilla to the wet ingredients after they have been removed from the heat! Mix it together! Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix well! Be sure everything is evenly distributed! Bake! This is the most important step! If you want chunky granola be sure to press the granola together in the pan. Bake for 30 minutes. Test for doneness. The granola usually feels soft to the touch when it first comes out of the oven, but hardens as it cools. To test for doneness take a few pieces of granola off the baking pan and let it cool. If it hardens and becomes crunchy then it's done!",

    "imagePath": "https://joyfoodsunshine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/chia-pudding-recipe-3.jpg",
    "ingredients": "1 cup milk (almond milk, cashew milk, whole milk, coconut milk, etc.), 2-4 TBS honey (or maple syrup) - to taste, 1 tsp pure vanilla extract, pinch fine sea salt, ¼ cup chia seeds, Optional toppings: fresh berries, sliced bananas, nut butter, extra maple syrup or honey, etc.",
    "howtoprepare" : "In a large bowl, whisk together milk, honey vanilla and sea salt until combined (it’s easier to incorporate honey if the milk is room temperature). Next, add the chia seeds and whisk to combine.  Then place the large bowl in the refrigerator to chill for 30 hour, stirring once halfway through.  NOTE: It's important to chill the mixture before transferring it into jars to ensure the chia seeds have started absorbing the liquid and they are evenly distributed throughout the mixture. Transfer the chia seed putting into 2-4 glass jars with lids and chill overnight in the refrigerator, or for at least 8 hours. Store this chia seed pudding in glass jars with airtight lids in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. I do not recommend freezing this chia pudding recipe. One chilled and thickened, serve this chia seed pudding with your favorite toppings. Here are some suggestions; Fresh or frozen & thawed berriesFresh fruits (bananas, apples, citrus fruits, etc.) Nut Butters (like this vanilla almond butter or this homemade peanut butter), unsweetened coconut, Candied almonds, Cinnamon Sugar pecans , Honey or Maple Syrup, Strawberry Sauce, Chocolate chips or cocoa nibs, Nuts (almonds, cashews, peanuts, etc.), Dried Fruits (cranberries, apricots, rasins, etc.)",
